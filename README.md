# Matlab-code-for-2D-atom-array
This program is to solve numerically the collective interaction between atom array and light

In the updated program, two_d_atom_array(_double_layer) is the main program of our project and contains the plot function of electric polarization intensity and 2D colored picture which indicates the spatial intensity of the eletric field. While the function gen_Gt is used to produce Green tensor and the rest is used to generate coordinates of atoms.
